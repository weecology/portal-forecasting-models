# portal-forecasting-models
Repo for connecting with the [Portal forecasting model doc on Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/12556055dvthwndmdmrm).  
*Note: Overleaf's Git bridge isn't perfect yet.  
If you edit on Overleaf, you'll need to do a manual bridge (fetch-merge-push) to GitHub. If you update the file on GitHub, it automatically bridges to Overleaf*.
